# IPÊ

This software is written in Go - the WYSIWYG lang

# Why I wrote this software?

1. I wanted to learn Go and I needed a non trivial application;
2. I use Pusher in some projects;
3. I really like Pusher;

# Features

* Public Channels;
* Private Channels;
* Presence Channels;
* Web Hooks;
* Client events;
* Complete REST API;
* Easy installation;
* A single binary without dependencies;
* Easy configuration;
* Protocol version 7;
* Multiple apps in the same instance;
* Drop in replacement for pusher server;

# Download pre built binaries

You can download pre built binaries from the [releases tab](https://github.com/dimiro1/ipe/releases).

I do not have a Windows machine, so I can only distribute binaries for amd64 linux and amd64 darwin.

```console
$ go get github.com/dimiro1/ipe
